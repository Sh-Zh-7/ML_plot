# Machine Learning Plot
When we do machine learning project, or other scientist activities like math modeling and so on. It's unavoidable to visualize your result. <br>
But we all know plotting is a kind of  Boilerplate code. So I decided to create a repo to record the code when we need to plot.<br>

## Classification
when you are doing classification problems. You can get following plot codes:
1. **distribution map of labels** 
2. **distribution map of features**
3. **heat map of given features** 
4. **learning curve**
5. **feature importances**
6. **ROC curve**
